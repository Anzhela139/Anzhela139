My main goal is to become a successful web-developer. Now I engage in web-design. But I find coding much more fascinating and reliable. I have to admit my lack of actual experience. All projects I did contribute were training. But I do learn fast, especially when I'm inspired. And I'm inspired to learn coding.

I know HTML, CSS and currently trying to learn JavaScript and PHP.

Education that I've had so far are course Web-design at Samara University, courses at HTML Academy and various online-seminars (mostly YouTube), a lot of books and articles.

I have learned English at school, then had three courses at university. For the most part all practice I had with English is reading a lot and watching courses.
